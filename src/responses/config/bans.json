Use Garv to flip up Bodal's Destructazooka to give him earth and flip up Scout's Monocular. Expend Bodal's earth to bring back your battlegear.\n3. When you fluidmorph, use Olkiex' trigger to flip Destructazooka down. Then use Scout's Monocular to flip it back up and give Bodal earth.\nThis will let you bring back a Battlegear every attack."

		"Primal Smash": "The biggest issue is that the decks that wouldn't benefit from their archetype by using primal are also inherently either low or not even on the tier list because the structure of the better and higher tier meta decks relies on something that isnt just attack value. War beast and strike are worth less than  even a moderately refined deck of wise guys. And while some war beast variant decks lose on primal, wise guys gains. So it would actually create a larger power disparity than already exists. And would reduce deck variety to boot because primal would become an active meta staple to help ensure remaining competitive against other meta decks.\nThe decks that do not benefit from primal already dont have enough going for them to break into higher tiers. Releasing primal does nothing for them. And only hurts them by boosting the power of many decks that are already more competitively viable.",
