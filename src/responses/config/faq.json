	"fizzle": "(8.5.1) First any targets of the Mugic or ability are rechecked to see if they are legal. If no targets are still legal then the Mugic or ability fails to resolve and is removed from the Burst.",
	"reopen": "(8.3.4) If a Triggered Ability is generated while a Burst is being built, that ability is added to the Burst prior to either player being able to extend that Burst. If more then one ability is generated by the same game event then the Active Player adds all of his or her abilities in the order of his or her choice first followed by the Non-Active Player. The Burst can then be extended as normal following the procedure in 8.2.2 with the player who has the choice of action being the one who would have had that choice in the absence of the addition of Triggered Abilities.",
    "multiple": "(8.3.3) When more than one triggered ability would be added to the Burst at the same time, the **Active Player** adds all of theirs to the Burst in any order they choose. Then the non-Active Player adds their in any order they choose. Meaning the non-active player's abilities will always be on top.\nE.G. If it's your turn with your Numin, you choose how to order them. You put Numin on top of your element gain, Numin resolves first and then you get your element. If your opponent has Numin, they put any abilities after your Numin, and they lose their elements.\nSee Comprehensive Rules 8.3.3 and 7.2.3",
