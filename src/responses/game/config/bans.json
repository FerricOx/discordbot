Equip you're fighter/defender (Lomma, Dessert Wanderer / Tangeth Toborn, OverWorld General) with Droskin (or other sacrifice gear).\n1. Engage in combat. Sacrifice you're battlegear.\n2. Use Garv to flip up Bodal's Destructazooka to give him earth and flip up Scout's Monocular. Expend Bodal's earth to bring back your battlegear.\n3. When you fluidmorph, use Olkiex' trigger to flip Destructazooka down. Then use Scout's Monocular to flip it back up and give Bodal earth.\nThis will let you bring back a Battlegear every attack.",
		"Primal Smash": "The biggest issue is that the decks that wouldn't benefit from their archetype by using primal are also inherently either low or not even on the tier list because the structure of the better and higher tier meta decks relies on something that isnt just attack value. War beast and strike are worth less than  even a moderately refined deck of wise guys. And while some war beast variant decks lose on primal, wise guys gains. So it would actually create a larger power disparity than already exists. And would reduce deck variety to boot because primal would become an active meta staple to help ensure remaining competitive against other meta decks.\nThe decks that do not benefit from primal already dont have enough going for them to break into higher tiers. Releasing primal does nothing for them. And only hurts them by boosting the power of many decks that are already more competitively viable.",

Flip new active location and illexia the danien queen gains a mc and you get to put hive amber on a creature\n4. Sacrifice wamma with hive amber too using the brainwashed Vilrik Landfarer. Illexia gains a mc and you can equip hive amber on illexia\n5. Activate hive amber and put a counter from illexia on rahmarhvir\n6. Deactivate with hiveunsung and remove a mugic counter any of your creatures besides ramarhvir\n7. Activate your other hive amber and put another counter anywhere except ramarhvir on rahmarhvir\n8. Deactivate hive with hiveunsung and pay a mugic anywhere except ramarhvir to being it back to tour hand again\n9. Activate ramarhvir ability to bring back wamma first.
